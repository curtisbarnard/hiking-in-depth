Hiking in depth is a progressive web application where users can find the perfect hike to suit their needs. There many websites with list of hikes in a local area, but wading through everything to find that perfect hike with wildflowers, that’s dog friendly and not very crowded is difficult. Hiking in depth allows users to find hikes nearby, filter hikes based on useful attributes, read in depth articles about the hikes and discover videos which make you feel like you’re on the hike.
